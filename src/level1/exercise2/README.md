# 🚀 Inheritance & Polymorphism Exercise

## 🧩 What’s This About?
This repository contains the solution to a programming exercise designed to strengthen my skills in Java development. The project showcases the implementation of core concepts using Java, version control with Git, and project management with IntelliJ IDEA.

## 📚 Exercise Overview
This repository contains the first programming exercise focused on Inheritance and Polymorphism in Java.

The objective was to strengthen our understanding of object-oriented programming by creating a class hierarchy that demonstrates inheritance and polymorphic behavior.
This project defines a Car class with the following attributes:

- brand: static final

- model: static

- power: final

It demonstrates the differences between these three types of variables and explores which of them can be initialized through the class constructor.
The main() method in the main class shows how to correctly call both the static and non-static methods.
