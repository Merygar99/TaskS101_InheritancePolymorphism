# 🚀 Inheritance & Polymorphism Exercise

## 🧩 What’s This About?
This repository contains the solution to a programming exercise designed to strengthen my skills in Java development. The project showcases the implementation of core concepts using Java, version control with Git, and project management with IntelliJ IDEA.

## 📚 Exercise Overview
This repository contains one programming exercise focused on Inheritance and Polymorphism in Java.

The objective was to strengthen our understanding of object-oriented programming by creating a class hierarchy that demonstrates inheritance and polymorphic behavior.
This project defines a Phone class with the attributes:

- brand

- model

It also includes a method call(String number) that prints a message to the console indicating a call is being made to the given number.

Two interfaces are defined:

- Camera with a method takePhoto()

- Clock with a method alarm()

A class called Smartphone extends Phone and implements both Camera and Clock.

The method implementations are:

- takePhoto() prints "Taking a photo"

- alarm() prints "The alarm is ringing"

In the main() method, an instance of Smartphone is created, and all the methods (call(), takePhoto(), and alarm()) are invoked to demonstrate functionality.

- **IDE:** IntelliJ IDEA
- **Version Control:** Git
- **Repository Hosting:** GitHub

## ✅ Requirements
- Java 17 or higher installed
- Git installed
- IntelliJ IDEA (Community or Ultimate edition)

## ▶️ Execution

To run the program in IntelliJ IDEA:

Open the file containing the main method (Main.java). Right-click anywhere in the editor window. Select Run 'Main.main()' from the context menu. Alternatively, use the green triangle (▶️) icon next to the main method to run the program directly.

## 📦 Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Merygar99/TaskS101_InheritancePolymorphism.git
