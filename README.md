🧬 **Java Inheritance & Polymorphism – Practice Exercises**

🧩 **About This Repository**

This repository contains a series of educational exercises aimed at practicing and understanding object-oriented programming principles in Java, particularly inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, and dynamic dispatch. The goal is to master how Java enables code reuse, flexibility, and extensibility through OOP.

📋 **Topics Covered**

🧱 **Inheritance**
  - Creating base classes (superclass) and subclasses (extends)

  - Inheriting attributes and methods

  - Using super to access superclass constructors and methods

  - Overriding vs. hiding members

  - Protected vs. private access modifiers

🎭 **Polymorphism**

  - Method overriding and dynamic method dispatch

  - Declaring objects using parent class references

  - Polymorphic behavior with arrays or collections of base types

  - Real-world use cases of interface-based polymorphism

🧩 **Abstract Classes & Interfaces**
  - Defining and using abstract classes

  - Creating reusable and extensible class hierarchies

  - Implementing interfaces and multiple inheritance of type

  - Comparing abstract classes vs interfaces

🧪 **Testing Polymorphic Behavior**
  - Writing JUnit tests to confirm correct method binding at runtime

  - Verifying subclass-specific behavior through base class references

🐾 **Casting & Type Checks**
  - Upcasting and downcasting with safety

  - Using instanceof for safe type evaluation

  - Avoiding ClassCastException

🎯 **Learning Objectives**
  - Understand the "is-a" relationship in inheritance

  - Apply polymorphism to write flexible, maintainable code

  - Use abstraction to separate interface from implementation

  - Handle object hierarchies and class design with clarity

  - Test dynamic behaviors using unit testing frameworks
